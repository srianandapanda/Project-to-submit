# MetaBase :

## Introduction :

Now a days data are most important and essential things, every day we deal with numerous numbers of data, and to store it we need a particular system. Data is most important and essential part now a days. As a result, getting familiar with data and work with it is now very useful and important. Let's take an example and try to relate with it, suppose someone working in a bank and bank manager wants to predict about the customer that going to churn their bank. For this purpose, he/she needs data. That data might be related to those who are not deposited the money since last five years, or we can do it by predicting the transaction that customer had made. May be this can be done by going through the database and analysing the previous record. So, as we know that data are essential, so we must also think that how to organise it and extract useful information from it is also important. And this can be done with the help of **Metabase**. Then what is metabase? Metabase is an open-source business intelligence tool that lets you create charts and dashboards using data from a variety of databases and data sources. You don't need to know SQL to create visualizations, but Metabase supports SQL for advanced customization. Metabase is a deep product with a lot of tools to simplify business intelligence, from embeddable charts and interactive dashboards to GUI and SQL editors, to auditing and data sandboxing, and more. This is the *what comes in the box when you install Metabase* article. Metabase has a lot of tools in its toolkit (and we can’t cover everything here), but even seasoned Metabasers will benefit from a tour of its feature set - especially since we add major new features at a regular clip.

## Use of metabase :

The versatility of its deployment on a variety of supported platforms is undeniable. The main use of it is to enable users to make data-driven decisions for growth. Let’s look at some features.
1. The Pulse Reporting Feature in Giving Updates
Its pulse reporting feature allows users within an organization to share Key Performance Indicators, objectives, and results. For example: The number of customers that lodged complaints and how many were attended to. How many users performed certain actions?

## Benefits:

1. The sharing of the dashboard and reporting quickly to relevant departments keep them updated on how the previous day, week, or month went.
2. They can make decisions on where to either improve or focus on.
3. The provision of metrics serves as a troubleshooting and monitoring tool for developers.
4. 
## What is Metabase: Analysis of Data in a Data Warehouse :

The pulse reporting feature also plays its part in this phase. It can be connected to a data warehouse to perform real-time analytics. The result of these analytics can be shared among different teams to keep tabs on Key Performance Indicators. The sharing of dashboards also enables individuals to perform explorative analysis to share with others. So, in an organizational setting where opinions and ideas are welcomed, there is room for creativity in the team.

## How to query and visualize your data :

Metabase supports a lot of different databases, and ships with a Sample Dataset for you to play around with. And once you’ve connected your data sources, Metabase gives you a lot of tools to explore them.

### Database :

How tables, rows, columns, and keys work together to make a database. If you’re going to get started using Metabase, it’s helpful to know a few key database terms.

**Table**

Fundamentally, databases are made up of one or more tables. Tables contain one or more columns and one or more rows. A row is made up of cells, and each cell has a value that corresponds to the column it falls under.

|Name |Age|
|---|---|
|John|25|
|Jenny|32|

Here, the columns are Name and Age. *The first row contains two cells, one with John and one with 25, corresponding to the Name and Age columns, respectively.*
So this is the information from which we need to extract data. There are hundreds of table and we need to use it all. So to do so and to visualise it clearly and to see in a graphical way we can use metabase.

## At the end :

Data is important and extracting useful information from it is also very important. To do so we can use metabase, it's given an interface to the user to deal with data. It can show various format in forms of graph to visualize data clearly and to get useful meaning from data.
